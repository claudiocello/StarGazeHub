## Technologies Used

StarGazeHub is built using the following technologies:

- React Native: A JavaScript framework for building mobile applications.
- Redux: A predictable state container for managing app state.
- React Navigation: A routing and navigation library for React Native apps.
- TypeScript: A statically typed superset of JavaScript for enhanced code quality.
- Axios: A promise-based HTTP client for making API requests.

## Testing

StarGazeHub includes unit tests to ensure code quality and reliability. The tests are written using Jest, a JavaScript testing framework, and can be run using the following command:

`npm test` or `yarn test`

The test suite covers various aspects of the application, including reducers, action creators, and components. To contribute to the project, ensure that all tests pass and consider adding new tests for any new features or changes.

## Test Coverage

StarGazeHub aims to maintain high test coverage to minimize bugs and ensure robustness. The test coverage report can be generated by running the following command:

`npm run coverage` or `yarn coverage`

The coverage report provides insights into which parts of the codebase are covered by tests and helps identify areas that may require additional testing.
